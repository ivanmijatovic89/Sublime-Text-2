# DogEars

## Named bookmarks for sublime text

DogEars allows you to create Bookmarks inside your code, and give them names. It also allows you to search for them using a quick panel (like the Ctrl + P Dialog)

### What works:

* Create a bookmark (Ctrl + Shift + B)  (you will need to enter a name)
* Access a bookmark (Ctrl + Shift + M  (note that this only works inside the file where the bookmarks exist)

### What doesn't work(yet):

* You can only access bookmarks in the same file for now.
* The bookmarks aren't stored on your hard drive. If you close Sublime Text, the bookmarks are lost
* Deleting bookmarks
* The bookmarks are still shown in case the section of text containing the bookmark has been deleted
* A single panel to show all the bookmarks
* Stability issues
